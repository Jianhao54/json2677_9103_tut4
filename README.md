# San Giorgio Maggiore in the Night Rain
The individual approach I made is mainly focusing on changing the mood of the original painting. By changing the colored version to black and white, it felt like more of a memory scene flash in my mind. 

It started from pixelation and eventually form the black and white painting. At this time, all the objects are still in the image. When interacting with clicking the canvas, the objects like the gulls, boat,the water wave and the rain become animated and the music starts playing.

I applied both audio and interaction into my work, because I felt like both of the background music and click to let objects become movable are necessary factors that helps creating the melancholy mood. Also, All I need is one click to make the still scene comes alive. I wanted to express a reflection on the passage of time in a vintage style, through my adapatation to the original painting. Before doing these, I have talked to my group member to do a completely different mood adaptation.

Here I want to point out several key techinques that I made in the adaptation. The first one is the Black and white filter, I referred to **Image Palette** from Happycoding https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/images/image-palette and how to make **filter in p5.js** https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/reference/#/p5.Filter on top of the image. For the raindrop effect, I looked over to the video called **Rain effect in p5.js** by MindforCode on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQysSfaLDyo, and a student's work called **rain and sun** by monicawen https://editor.p5js.org/monicawen/sketches/HkU-BCJqm. Then I did some research since the group work about the **Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm** from tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/dsa_fisher_yates_shuffle_algorithm.htm. By creating a loop to ramdomly change position of squares in the array, Perlin noise technique also used based on the block's offset, amplitude, and frequency in the wave motion.
