# San Giorgio Maggiore in the Night Rain
The individual approach I made is mainly focusing on changing the mood of the original painting. By changing the colored version to black and white, it felt like more of a memory scene flash in my mind. 

It started with pixelation and eventually formed the black-and-white painting. At this time, all the objects are still in the image. When interacting by clicking the canvas, the objects like the gulls, boat, the water wave and the rain become animated and the music starts playing.

I applied both audio and interaction into my work, because both the background music and click to let objects become movable are necessary factors that help create the melancholy mood. Also, All I need is one click to make the still scene come alive. I wanted to express a reflection on the passage of time in a vintage style, through my adaptation to the original painting. Before doing these, I talked to my group members to do a completely different mood adaptation.

Here I want to point out several key techniques that I made in the adaptation. The first one is the Black and white filter, I referred to **Image Palette** from Happycoding https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/images/image-palette and how to make **filter in p5.js** https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/reference/#/p5.Filter on top of the image. For the raindrop effect, I looked over to the video called **Rain effect in p5.js** by MindforCode on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQysSfaLDyo, and a student's work called **rain and sun** by monicawen https://editor.p5js.org/monicawen/sketches/HkU-BCJqm. Then I did some research since the group work about the **Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm** from tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/dsa_fisher_yates_shuffle_algorithm.htm. By creating a loop to randomly change the position of squares in the array, the Perlin noise technique is also used based on the block's offset, amplitude, and frequency in the wave motion.
